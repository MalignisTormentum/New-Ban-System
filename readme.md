Compare to my old one that was written entirely in Python. This one was split into three different languages instead, and steps were taken to reduce the amount of if-statements used. This bot is designed to ban players from Roblox games entirely from Discord.

You can use a host such as Host Gator and simply copy my server.php file and upload it as database_connection.php then edit the link vaiable in the client and bot files to be https://www.YOURSITE.com/database_connection.php. The SQL file can be run
to set up your database.

Feel free to send me a request on Discord at MalignisTormentum#1187 if you have any suggestions or comments. Input is appreciated.
