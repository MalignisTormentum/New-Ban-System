I have practiced some caching for the bot but more caching could be used throughout the entire system and other steps could be taken to reduce hits to the database which should be treated as valuable.
This bot is designed to ban players from Roblox games entirely from Discord.

You can use a host such as Host Gator and simply copy my server.php file and upload it as database_connection.php then edit the link vaiable in the client and bot files to be https://www.YOURSITE.com/database_connection.php.
